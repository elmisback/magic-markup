    "problemDescription": "Problem: Grocery Store Shopping Cart\n\nIn this intermediate-level JavaScript programming problem, we will create a simplified shopping cart for a grocery store. The goal is to implement a shopping cart that allows users to add, remove, and view the items they have selected for purchase. The shopping cart should also calculate the total price of the items.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a JavaScript file to hold our code: We will create a single JavaScript file to implement our shopping cart functionality. We can name the file \"shoppingCart.js\".\n\n2. Define an empty array to hold the items: We will create an empty array called \"cart\" that will hold the selected items.\n\n3. Implement a function to add items to the cart: We will create a function called \"addItem\" that takes an item object as a parameter and adds it to the cart array.\n\n4. Implement a function to remove items from the cart: We will create a function called \"removeItem\" that takes the item name as a parameter and removes the corresponding item from the cart array.\n\n5. Implement a function to calculate the total price: We will create a function called \"calculateTotalPrice\" that iterates over the items in the cart array and calculates the total price by summing up the prices of all the items.\n\n6. Implement a function to view the items in the cart: We will create a function called \"viewCart\" that displays the items in the cart array along with their prices.\n\n7. Test the functionality: Finally, we will write some test code to ensure that our shopping cart functions correctly. We can add items, remove items, calculate the total price, and view the cart to verify that everything is working as expected.\n\nBy following these steps, we will be able to create a JavaScript program that simulates a grocery store shopping cart, allowing users to manage their selected items and view the total price.",

Your task is to calculate the average weekly sales for each store in the chain. \n\nThe weekly sales data is provided in a text file named \"sales.txt\". Each line in the file represents the sales for a particular day. The format of each line is as follows: \"Store_Name Day_of_the_Week Sales_Amount\".\n\nYour objective is to write a Python program that reads the \"sales.txt\" file, calculates the average weekly sales for each store, and outputs the results.\n\nSteps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Open the \"sales.txt\" file for reading.\n2. Create an empty dictionary to store the weekly sales data for each store.\n3. Iterate over each line in the file using a loop.\n4. Split each line into three parts: store name, day of the week, and sales amount.\n5. Check if the store name exists in the dictionary. If not, add it as a key and initialize the value as a list.\n6. Append the sales amount to the list associated with the store name.\n7. Repeat steps 4 to 6 for all lines in the file.\n8. Close the file after the loop ends.\n9. Create a new dictionary to store the average weekly sales for each store.\n10. Iterate over the dictionary of weekly sales data for each store.\n11. Calculate the average sales by summing all the values in the list and dividing by the number of elements.\n12. Add the average sales as a value in the new dictionary, with the store name as a key.\n13. Print the results, showing the average weekly sales for each store.\n14.

Your task is to write a C program to calculate the shortest path between two given coordinates in a city, so that the drone can deliver packages quickly and efficiently. The city is represented as a grid of locations, each location being either a road or a building. The shortest path must only consider roads and avoid buildings.\n\nSteps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Read the input:\n   - Read the dimensions of the city grid (number of rows and columns).\n   - Read the grid layout, where each cell can either be 'R' (road) or 'B' (building).\n   - Read the starting and ending coordinates.\n\n2. Validate the input:\n   - Check if the starting and ending coordinates are within the grid boundaries.\n   - Ensure that the starting and ending positions are roads ('R') and not buildings ('B').\n\n3. Create a data structure to represent the city grid:\n   - Use a 2D array to store the grid layout.\n   - Store 'R' for road and 'B' for building in each corresponding cell.\n\n4. Implement a path-finding algorithm:\n   - There are various algorithms that can be used, such as Dijkstra's algorithm or A* (A star) algorithm.\n   - Choose an algorithm that suits the requirements and complexity constraints.\n   - Implement the algorithm to find the shortest path between the starting and ending positions, considering only road cells.\n\n5. Output the shortest path:\n   - Once the shortest path is found, output the path as a sequence of coordinates or as the grid with the path marked.\n   - Optionally, you can calculate and display the total distance or steps required to travel the shortest path.\n\n6. Test and debug:\n   - Run the program with various test cases, including edge cases, to ensure the correctness of the implementation.\n   - Debug any issues that arise during testing.\n\n7. Optimize if required:\n   - Depending on the performance requirements, you may need to optimize the algorithm or data structure to handle larger city grids efficiently.\n\n8. Document and finalize:\n   - Comment your code to clarify its functionality and add any necessary documentation.\n   - Review and finalize the code.\n\nNote: This problem can be solved in a single C file by implementing the necessary functions and structures. The functions can be separated into smaller modules if required.",

    "problemDescription": "Problem: \nSuppose you are working as a cashier at a grocery store and your manager has asked you to write a program that calculates the total amount of money in a customer's cart. The store has a special discount policy where if a customer buys 5 or more items, they get a 10% discount on their total purchase. Your task is to write a C program that reads the number of items purchased by the customer and their respective prices, calculate the total bill amount, and apply the discount if applicable.\n\nSteps to solve the problem:\n1. Start by declaring and initializing necessary variables, such as `numItems` (representing the number of items in the cart), `totalAmount`, and `discountedAmount`.\n2. Prompt the user to enter the number of items in the cart using `printf` and accept the input using `scanf`.\n3. Use a loop to iterate `numItems` times to read the price of each item and calculate the `totalAmount` by summing up the prices.\n4. Check if `numItems` is greater than or equal to 5. If true, calculate the `discountedAmount` as 10% of `totalAmount` (0.1 * `totalAmount`) and subtract it from `totalAmount`. Else, set `discountedAmount` to 0.\n5. Display the `totalAmount` and `discountedAmount` to the user using `printf`.\n6. End the program.\n\nExample Input/Output:\n```\nEnter the number of items in the cart: 7\nEnter the price of item 1: 10\nEnter the price of item 2: 5\nEnter the price of item 3: 8\nEnter the price of item 4: 2\nEnter the price of item 5: 15\nEnter the price of item 6: 6\nEnter the price of item 7: 12\n\nTotal amount: $58.00\nDiscounted amount: $5.80\n```\n\nNote: Depending on the specific requirements, the program can be enhanced by checking for valid input (e.g., non-negative prices), displaying appropriate error messages, and allowing the user to continue entering prices until they input a sentinel value.",

    "updateDescription": "An interesting change or refactoring that a real-world programmer might apply to this code is to introduce error handling and input validation.\n\nCurrently, the program assumes that the user will always enter valid temperature and humidity readings. However, in real-world scenarios, it is important to handle invalid input gracefully and provide appropriate error messages.\n\nThis can be achieved by adding input validation checks after reading the temperature and humidity inputs. The program can check if the values entered are within valid ranges. For example, it can validate that the temperature is not below absolute zero or above a certain upper limit, and that the humidity is not negative or above 100%. If the inputs are invalid, the program can display an error message and prompt the user to enter valid values.\n\nBy adding input validation and error handling, the code becomes more robust and user-friendly, as it can handle unexpected or incorrect input gracefully rather than producing unpredictable results or crashing.",

    "problemDescription": "Problem: Create a program to simulate a simple weather forecasting system.\n\nDescription:\nYou have been hired to develop a simple weather forecasting system for a local news station. The program will take input from the user in the form of temperature and humidity readings, and based on predefined thresholds, predict the weather conditions for the day.\n\nSteps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Define the thresholds: Determine the temperature and humidity ranges for different weather conditions. For example, you may consider the following thresholds:\n   - Temperature: below 10°C (cold weather), between 10°C and 25°C (moderate weather), above 25°C (hot weather).\n   - Humidity: below 30% (dry weather), between 30% and 70% (moderate weather), above 70% (humid weather).\n\n2. Input temperature and humidity readings: Prompt the user to enter the temperature and humidity readings for the day.\n\n3. Determine weather conditions: Use if-else statements and logical operators to evaluate the temperature and humidity readings against the defined thresholds. Create subexpressions to categorize the weather conditions based on the inputs. For example:\n   - If temperature is below 10°C and humidity is below 30%, output: \"Cold and dry weather.\"\n   - If temperature is between 10°C and 25°C and humidity is between 30% and 70%, output: \"Moderate weather.\"\n   - If temperature is above 25°C and humidity is above 70%, output: \"Hot and humid weather.\"\n\n4. Output the weather conditions: Display the predicted weather conditions based on the inputs provided by the user.\n\n5. Test the program: Run the program with different temperature and humidity inputs to verify that it produces the expected results.\n\nNote: This is just a simple example of a weather forecasting system for educational purposes. Real-world weather forecasting involves much more complex algorithms and data analysis techniques.",
    "snippetDescription": "One subexpression in this program is the condition `(temperature < 10 && humidity < 30)` in the if statement. This subexpression checks if the temperature is below 10 degrees Celsius and the humidity is below 30%, indicating cold and dry weather conditions.",
