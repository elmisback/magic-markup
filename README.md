# :anchor: Codetations 

:construction: **Under construction! Don't use this library yet unless you are ready to hack on things.** :construction:

Codetations are *location anchors* for code that allow referencing a particular snippet even after the code has been changed. 
It is possible for these anchors to live separately from the code to avoid affecting the editing experience.
