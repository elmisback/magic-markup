# :anchor: Codetations 

:construction: **Under construction! Don't use this library yet unless you are ready to hack on things.** :construction:

Codetations are *location anchors* for code that allow referencing a particular location even after the code has been changed. 
It is possible for these anchors to live separately from the code to avoid affecting the editing experience.

A live demo of this behavior (with source code) is available [on Observable](https://observablehq.com/d/88e85f5624523df6).

This repository will include:
* a server for interacting with the stored annotations intended for editor plugins and visualization clients
* a program for automatically updating stored annotation positions using diffs and anchor information 
if the code was edited without a connection to the annotation server
* a description of the annotation storage format(s) used by codetations

## Strategy
Keeping track of positions as code changes and moves between contributors is not an easy problem. Codetations aims to provide a robust solution to this problem using the following methods:
* a server for editor clients to update annotation positions during editing
* loose language-aware parsing for resolving positions as expression delimiters
* a plain-text fallback implemented with text diffing + string similarity, in case the parser fails or is unavailable for a language
