  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    Codetations are annotation location anchors for code that allow referencing a particular location even after the code has been changed. 
    It is possible for these anchors to live separately from the code to avoid affecting the editing experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the gif below, edits occur on the upper buffer, and the lower buffer is resolved by comparing the upper buffer to an annotated version of 
    the initial state (at the beginning of the edit session) of the upper buffer. <strong>No edit information other than the final output is used</strong>,
    demonstrating that locations can be tracked with some success without edit session access.

  <h2>Motivation & Significance for Scholarly Communication</h2>
  <p>
    In order to talk about something, we must have a way to refer to it. When we informally discuss and think about code in an existing library, 
    we often do so at the level of code expressions, asking "what does this line do?". However, when we want to run code in a library,
    we are typically limited to describing code executions
    at the level of functions--you can't run just one line of a program. Sometimes we solve this by copying lines into a REPL, but the copy cannot
    respond to changes in the original code. But what if we could instead persistently refer to and execute code in place at the line or expression level? 
    This would expand our ability to understand and specify how code behaves. After all, code is easiest to run and make "live" if it's just a couple of lines.
  </p>
  <h3>Applications</h3>
  <p>
    Besides being generally useful for programming tools, expression-level annotation 
    has special application to fields like education and programming languages, where the meaning and behavior of individual expressions is studied carefully.
    Tools for these fields can take advantage of persistent annotation points to offer extensive commentary without interrupting the view of the code, or
    to attach expression debuggers that visualize data flowing through an expression even if the rest of the program won't compile.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the long term, execution data gathered from user interactions with annotation points might be used to understand how data flows through the program as a whole.

  <h2>Project progress</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>I've already implemented a VSCode client (<a href="https://github.com/elmisback/viviquote">viviquote</a>) for watching the values of expressions as an example of the kind of tool that will benefit from persistent annotations.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  (See gif above.)
  <ul>
    <li>I implemented a program for automatically updating stored annotation positions using diffs and anchor information 
      if the code was edited without a connection to the annotation server, but it is well behind state-of-the-art based on some papers I recently found.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>I informally tested mixtures of different algorithms and heuristics for this tool.</li>
        <li>I determined that my first purely diff-based approach is:
          <ul>
            <li> excellent for predictability, handling annotations uniformly regardless of their length, and good at handling additional/removed lines, but</li>
            <li> bad at correctly resolving the new position for in-line changes that are adjacent to an annotation start/end, and</li>
            <li> incapable of changing the order of annotations if code is moved around.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Heuristics can be used on diffs to improve results in a predictable way.</li>
        <li>String similarity can be used (as suggested by Rástočný and Bieliková 2013) for decent but much less predictable results.</li>
        <li>String similarity performance requires much more attention than diffing to avoid blowups, and includes parameters that must be tuned, like the amount of context to consider. 
          It's also not immediately clear why the algorithm suggested (Jaro-Winkler) is good for finding positions in documents, since it gives higher weight to earlier characters.
          I wrote and tested a two-sided variant that didn't seem to improve things.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>AST parse information is not yet considered, and the codetations server (which should react to edits and provide an interface for accessing annotations) is not yet complete.</li>
  </ul>

    <li>Brush presents a method for robustly attaching annotations to digital documents using multiple sources of metadata and context. 
      Natural language and HTML have different characteristics from source code, but we can take as an analogy from this work the notion 
      of paths through a loosely-parsed AST as possible anchoring information.</li>

    <li>Juhar introduces a tool called Connotator that supports a variety of annotation types. 
      This is a significant paper for distinguishing different types of annotations--
      above, we have described what Juhar calls External Annotations, but other kinds of annotations (for example, comments with metadata) are possible too. 
      Juhar's tool is specific to JetBrains IntelliJ platform-based IDEs, and Juhar claims that EAs require an external tool for maintenance.
      While this is technically true, we have tried to show here that it may be possible for the annotations to survive "offline" periods.</li>

    <li>The authors evaluate the effectiveness of various string similarity algorithms for anchoring on a set of 12 test cases. 
      Our diffing approach is faster and stabler than string similarity for the kinds of annotations we are considering from our preliminary tests, but it struggles to handle changes in annotation order.</li>
